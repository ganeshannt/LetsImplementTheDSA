Stable vs Unstable sort:

    => A sorting algorithm is said to be stable if two objects with equal keys appear in the same order in the sorted output as they appear in the unsorted input.

    => Whereas a sorting algorithm is said to be unstable if there are two or more objects with equal keys which donâ€™t appear in same order before and after sorting.

Stable Algorithm:
    Insertion Sort
    Bubble Sort
    Merge Sort
    Count Sort

Unstable Algorithm:
    Quick Sort
    Heap Sort




In-Place Sorting algorithm:

    => An In-Place Sorting Algorithm directly modifies the list that is received as input instead of creating a new list that is then modified.

    => In-Place, Sorting Algorithm updates input only through replacement or swapping of elements.

    Bubble sort
    insertion sort
    selection sort

Comparison based sorting algorithms:
a) In comparison-based sorting algorithms, we need to compare elements of a collection with each other in order to identify the correct order of elements
b) Algorithms in this category have a complexity lower bound of nlogn.

Non-comparison based sorting algorithms:
a) Unlike comparison-based algorithms, non-comparison-based sorting algorithms use additional information and operations other than simple elements comparison to determine the correct sorted order.
b) As a result, they don't bound to the complexity of nlogn
