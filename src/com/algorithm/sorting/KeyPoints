Stable vs Unstable sort:

    => A sorting algorithm is said to be stable if two objects with equal keys appear in the same order in the sorted output as they appear in the unsorted input.

    => Whereas a sorting algorithm is said to be unstable if there are two or more objects with equal keys which donâ€™t appear in same order before and after sorting.

Stable Algorithm:
    Insertion Sort
    Bubble Sort
    Merge Sort
    Count Sort

Unstable Algorithm:
    Quick Sort
    Heap Sort




In-Place Sorting algorithm:

    => An In-Place Sorting Algorithm directly modifies the list that is received as input instead of creating a new list that is then modified.

    => In-Place, Sorting Algorithm updates input only through replacement or swapping of elements.
